# Comparative genomics analysis of bat genomes

This repository contains scripts, configuration files and key data for the setup of a genome browser, comparative genomics analyses, and for plotting main figures to reproduce work conducted in the manuscript "Long-read sequencing reveals rapid evolution of immunity- and cancer-related genes in bats". Further details on how data were generated and analysed is provided in the Methods and Results sections of the manuscript.

* `browser`: generation of input data and configuration files for a custom UCSC bat genome browser 
* `indel`: scripts and example files for calling short indels from a multiple alignment
* `cafe`: scripts and data for gene family size expansion and contraction analysis with CAFE5
* `psg`: scripts for positive selection scans with PAML and HYPHY
* `plot`: scripts and data for plotting in R
